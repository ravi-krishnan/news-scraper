NEW DELHI (AP) — Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling Hindu nationalist party won the most seats in the high-stakes state legislature election  in India’s federal territory, including New Delhi, for the first time in over a quarter-century, according to official data on Saturday.
Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party won 47 seats in the 70-member assembly that includes India’s capital of 20 million people, ousting the Aam Aadmi Party, or AAP, that ruled New Delhi since 2015. The AAP won 22 seats. The outcome of the race in one remaining seat had yet to be declared, according to the Election Commission of India.

India’s main opposition Congress party lost on all seats for the third consecutive term.
In a major upset, the AAP founder and leader Arvind Kejriwal and his deputy, Manish Sisodia, lost their seats despite their party having built widespread support with its welfare policies and anti-corruption movement.
“We accept the mandate of the people with great humility,” Kejriwal said in a video statement while congratulating the BJP on its victory. He said he hoped that the BJP would fulfil its election promises.
“We have done a lot of work in the field of health, education, and infrastructure in the last 10 years,” Kejriwal said. “We will not only play the role of a constructive opposition but will also remain among the people and continue to serve them.”
Waving party flags and posters of Modi, supporters of the BJP chanted slogans and danced outside its headquarters in the capital as vote results began trickling with most exit polls predicting the party’s win.

The BJP’s Amit Shah, who is India’s powerful home minister, said his party’s victory signified that “people can’t be misled with lies every time.” He said under the leadership of Modi, the BJP would make New Delhi ”the world’s No. 1 capital by fulfilling all promises.”
“Our victory is a sign of the people’s faith in Prime Minister Modi’s vision of progress,” he said in a statement. 
Saturday’s victory is seen as a big boost for the BJP after it failed to secure a majority on its own in last year’s national election but formed the government with coalition partners. It gained some lost ground by winning two state elections in northern Haryana and western Maharashtra states last year.
Ahead of the election, Modi’s party slashed income taxes on the salaried middle class, one of its key voting blocs, in the federal budget.
During the electioneering, both Modi and Kejriwal offered to revamp government schools and provide free health services and electricity, along with a monthly stipend of over 2,000 rupees ($25) to poor women.
Kejriwal was arrested last year along with two key party leaders on charges of receiving bribes from a liquor distributor. They have denied the accusations, saying they are part of a political conspiracy. 
The Supreme Court allowed the release of Kejriwal and other ministers on bail. Kejriwal later relinquished the chief minister’s post to his most senior party leader, Atishi, who won her seat on Saturday.

Opposition parties widely condemned Kejriwal’s arrest, accusing Modi’s government of misusing federal investigation agencies to harass and weaken political opponents. They pointed to several raids, arrests and corruption investigations of key opposition figures before the national election.
Kejriwal formed the AAP in 2012 after tapping into public anger over corruption scandals. His pro-poor policies have focused on fixing state-run schools and providing cheap electricity, free health care and bus transport for women.
In 2020, the AAP won 62 out of 70 seats in a landslide victory in the last state legislature election, leaving the BJP with eight and the Congress party with none. 
The BJP was voted out of power in Delhi in 1998 by the Congress party, which ran the government for 15 years.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump greeted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House with a bear hug on Thursday and called him “a great friend of mine,” but nonetheless warned that India won’t be spared from higher tariffs he’s begun imposing on U.S. trade partners around the world. 
Trump, who had previously derided India as the “tariff king,” called the import levies imposed by Modi’s country “very unfair and strong.” 
“Whatever India charges, we charge them,” Trump said at a joint news conference where he stood next to Modi. “So, frankly, it no longer matters to us that much what they charge.” 
As he has while recently hosting other foreign leaders, Trump talked about ensuring that the U.S. erases its trade deficit with India. He suggested that could be done by increasing U.S. energy exports to India but also promised to restore “fairness and reciprocity” to the economic relationship and said he and Modi had begun working on a major trade deal that could be completed later this year. 
The U.S. and India have a trade deficit of $50 billion in India’s favor. The Indo-U.S. goods and services trade totaled around $190.1 billion in 2023. According to India’s External Affairs Ministry, the U.S. exports to India were worth nearly $70 billion and imports $120 billion.
Modi, meanwhile, continued his personal trend of heaping praise on Trump. The prime minister said that he’s determined to “Make India Great Again,” or “MIGA” — a play on the president’s “MAGA” or “Make America Great Again” catchphrase and movement.


Trump also said he’d back extraditing one of the plotters of the 2008 Mumbai attacks — appearing to referencing Tahawwur Hussain Rana, who was convicted in 2011 in the U.S. for plotting an attack on a Danish newspaper. 
“He’s going to be going back to India to face justice,” Trump said. The president later added, “We’re giving him back to India immediately” and that more such extraditions could be coming. 
Trump also said the U.S. would soon increase military sales to India by “many millions of dollars,” paving the way to ultimately provide India with the F-35 stealth fighter planes — something the country has long sought. 
Before Modi’s White House arrival, Trump signed an order to increase tariffs to match the tax rates that other countries charge on imports, which affects American trading partners around the world — including India.
Modi had been looking to avoid additional U.S. tariffs and to improve relations with Washington and the West overall, which have been frosty lately after Modi refused to condemn Russia for its war on Ukraine. 
“The world had this thinking that India somehow is a neutral country in this whole process,” Modi said, praising Trump for having phone calls with Russia and Ukraine’s leaders on Wednesday. “But this is not true. India has a side, and that side is of peace.”
Trump previously imposed tariffs on China, and says more are coming against the European Union — while threatening similar against Canada and Mexico. He also expanded tariffs on steel and aluminum he initially imposed during his first term. 
The White House insists that in signing Thursday’s round of what Trump called “reciprocal” tariffs, he is leveling the playing field between U.S. manufacturers and foreign competitors. These new taxes would likely be paid by American consumers and businesses either directly or in the form of higher prices, though. 
Even before Modi arrived, New Delhi showed a willingness to buy more American oil and lower its tariffs on U.S. goods. That included levies on some Harley-Davidson motorcycles going from 50% to 40%. Also, India in 2023 dropped retaliatory tariffs on U.S. almonds, apples, chickpeas, lentils and walnuts. 
Tariffs aside, Trump has used the opening weeks of his second term to say he’ll stamp out U.S. trade deficits around the world, including during his meetings at the White House last week with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. 
Modi is the fourth foreign leader to visit Trump since his inauguration last month, following Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Ishiba of Japan and Jordan’s King Abdullah II.
Prior to meeting with Trump, Modi sat down with national security adviser Mike Waltz. He also met with billionaire SpaceX founder and top Trump administration official Elon Musk.
Trump was asked if Musk spoke with Modi as a government worker or a tech magnate, amid concerns the meeting was related to the billionaire’s business dealings.
“India is a very hard place to do business because of the tariffs. They have the highest tariffs, just about in the world, and it’s a hard place to do business,” Trump said. “No, I would imagine he met possibly because, you know, he’s running a company.”
Modi and Trump also said they’d discussed immigration. 
India recently accepted the return of 104 migrants brought back on a U.S. military plane — the first such flight to the country as part of the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration and the U.S.-Mexico border.
More than 725,000 immigrants from India are in the U.S. without authorization, the third most of any country after Mexico and El Salvador, according to the Pew Research Center.
Recent years have also seen a jump in the number of Indians attempting to enter through the U.S.-Canada border. The U.S. Border Patrol arrested more than 14,000 Indians in the year ending Sept. 30 -- 60% of all arrests there and more than 10 times the number from two years ago.
Trump has promised a “mass deportation” of all who are in the U.S. illegally. Modi said Thursday that, “Any verified Indian who is in the U.S. illegally, we are fully prepared to take them back to India.”

NEW DELHI (AP) — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist party was trying to regain power in the federal territory that includes New Delhi on Wednesday as residents voted in a state legislature election.
Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party hasn’t won the territory that includes India’s capital of 20 million people in over a quarter-century.
The BJP is up against the Aam Aadmi Party led by Arvind Kejriwal, which runs New Delhi and has built widespread support with its welfare policies and anti-corruption movement. But Kejriwal, a popular anti-corruption crusader, suffered a setback after he and other AAP leaders faced graft allegations.
Election results are due Saturday. More than 15 million people are eligible to vote.
The BJP failed to secure a majority on its own in last year’s national election but formed the government with coalition partners. It has gained some lost ground by winning two state elections in northern Haryana and western Maharashtra states.
Ahead of this election, both Modi and Kejriwal offered to revamp government schools and provide free health services and electricity, along with a monthly stipend of over 2,000 rupees ($25) to poor women.
Modi’s party hopes to benefit after last week’s federal budget slashed income taxes on the salaried middle class, one of its key voting blocs.
The AAP won 62 out of 70 seats in a landslide victory in the last state legislature election in 2020. leaving BJP with eight and the Congress party with none. The BJP was voted out of power in Delhi in 1998 by the Congress party, which ran the government for 15 years.


Political analyst Neerja Chowdhury said this time, the corruption case has dented Kejriwal’s image.
Kejriwal was arrested last year along with two key party leaders on charges of receiving bribes from a liquor distributor. They have denied the accusations, saying they are part of a political conspiracy. The Supreme Court allowed the release of Kejriwal and other ministers on bail. Kejriwal later relinquished the chief minister’s post to his most senior party leader.

2 days agoShareSaveMeryl SebastianBBC News, KochiShareSaveIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has become one of the few world leaders to join Truth Social, the social media platform owned by US President Donald Trump.In his first post on Monday, Modi shared a photo with Trump taken in Houston, Texas, during his 2019 US visit and said he was "delighted" to be on the platform.Trump launched Truth Social in February 2022 after he lost the presidential election to Joe Biden and was temporarily banned from major social networks like Twitter and Facebook, which accused him of inciting violence.As of 03:30 GMT, Modi had 21,500 followers and was following Trump and US Vice President JD Vance.On Monday, Trump shared a link to an interview which Modi did with podcaster Lex Fridman where the Indian prime minister spoke on a range of topics, including his life journey, the Gujarat riots of 2002 and India's relationship with China. Much of Truth Social's functionality is identical to X, formerly Twitter. Users are able to post 'truths' or 'retruths' as well as send direct messages. Adverts on the platform are called 'sponsored truths'. Truth Social is owned by Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG). Trump took the company public in March 2024 and now owns about 57% shares in the firm.Kuwaiti-headquartered investment firm ARC Global Investments and some former Apprentice contestants also have a sizeable stakes, though those holdings are currently subject to legal fights.The US president has 9.28m followers on Truth Social, far fewer than the 87m he has on X.According to data compiled by Bloomberg, traffic at Truth Social remains minuscule relative to its competitors, with its total user numbers trailing X by 400 times.TMTG reported losses of $400m (£308m) in 2024 and a revenue of $3.6m. It has a market valuation of $4.45bn.

14 February 2025ShareSaveSoutik Biswas and Nikhil InamdarBBC News, DelhiShareSaveDespite the hype, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's first visit to Washington under Donald Trump's second term was a sober, business-first affair - unsurprising for a working visit, which lacks the pomp of a state visit.Trump announced expanded US military sales to India from 2025, including F-35 jets, along with increased oil and gas exports to narrow the trade deficit. Both sides agreed to negotiate a trade deal and finalise a new defence framework. He also confirmed the US had approved the extradition of Tahawwur Rana, a Chicago businessman accused of playing a role in the 2008 terror attack in Mumbai."That's a lot of deliverables for an administration less than a month old," Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center's South Asia Institute in Washington told the BBC"Overall, both sides seem comfortable continuing Biden-era collaborations, particularly in tech and defence, though many will be rebranded under Trump."Still, major challenges lie ahead. Here are the key takeaways:Modi's visit came as Trump ordered that US trading partners should face reciprocal tariffs - tit-for-tat import taxes to match similar duties already charged by those countries on American exports. He ordered advisers to draft broad new tariffs on US trade partners, warning they could take effect by 1 April.India enjoys a trade surplus with the US, its top trading partner. India cut average tariffs from 13% to 11% in its federal budget in a bid to pre-empt Trump's tariff moves. The jury is out on whether India appears to have dodged tariff shocks for now.Ajay Srivastava, founder of the Delhi-based think tank Global Trade Research Institute (GTRI), says he doesn't see any "problems with tariffs".The main reason, he says, is that 75% of the US exports to India attract import taxes of less than 5%."Trump points to extreme outlier tariffs like 150% on select items, but that's not the norm. India has little reason to fear reciprocal tariffs," Mr Srivastava told the BBC.Abhijit Das, former head of the Centre for WTO Studies at the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade, isn't convinced."The devil lies in the details. Reciprocal tariffs won't just mirror India's import taxes -other factors will come into play," he told the BBC.Trump's approach could go beyond import duties, factoring in value added tax (VAT), non-tariff barriers and trade restrictions. While India's goods and services tax (GST) on imported goods aligns with WTO rules, Trump may still use it to justify higher tariffs.A US government memo on reciprocal tariffs hints at this strategy, citing costs to American businesses from non-tariff barriers, subsidies and burdensome regulations abroad. It also cites VAT and government procurement restrictions as non-tariff barriers.Mr Das says the US is expected to push for access to India's government procurement market, which is currently protected. "This will hamper India's ability to prioritise domestic producers, posing a direct challenge to the 'Make in India' initiative. This is certainly not good news for us." Mr Das suggests that India should counter Trump's reciprocal tariff logic, particularly in agriculture where the US imposes strict non-tariff barriers that restrict Indian exports such as stiff maximum residue limits on chemicals. He argues that since the US "heavily subsidises" its farm sector, India should highlight these subsidies to push back against American claims.Tariffs alone may not help bridge the trade deficit between the two countries. Defence and energy purchases will go some way in addressing the deficit, experts say.The new $500bn (£400bn) trade goal aims to more than double the $190bn trade between the two countries in 2023.Modi and Trump committed to negotiating the first phase of a trade agreement by autumn 2025. Talks will focus on market access, tariff reductions and supply chain integration across goods and services."The announcement that the two sides will pursue a trade deal gives India an opportunity to negotiate for reduced tariffs on both sides. That would be a boon not only for the US-India relationship, but also for an Indian economy that's sputtered in recent months," says Mr Kugelman.What is not clear is what kind of trade deal the both sides will be aiming at."What is this trade agreement? Is it a full blown free trade agreement or is it a reciprocal tariff deal?" wonders Mr Srivastava. Mr Das believes we'll have to wait for details on the trade agreement. "It doesn't necessarily mean a free trade deal - if that were the case, it would have been stated explicitly. It could simply involve tariff reductions on select products of mutual interest."Priyanka Kishore, principal economist at the Singapore-based consultancy firm, Asia Decoded, says $500bn is a "tall target but there are low hanging fruit we can immediately exploit"."For instance the US sanctions on Russian shadow fleet are soon going to kick in, so India can easily pivot to the US for more oil. This will not be too difficult."Trump said at the joint press conference that the US would hopefully become India's number one supplier of oil and gas. India's defence trade with the US has surged from near zero to $20 billion, making the US its third-largest arms supplier. While Russia remains India's top source, its share has dropped from 62% to 34% (2017-2023) as India shifts toward US procurement.In a major announcement to deepen defence ties, Trump said the US would increase military equipment sales to India "by many billions of dollars starting this year" ultimately paving the way to providing the F-35 stealth warplanes.But this will be easier said than done, say experts."This sounds good, but it may be a case of putting the cart before the horse," says Mr Kugelman.Despite rising US arms sales to India, bureaucratic hurdles and export controls limit the transfer of sensitive technologies, he says. The new defence framework announced at the summit may help address these challenges.Also India isn't "taking the F-35 offer seriously" due to high maintenance demands, says strategic affairs expert Ajai Shukla. Shukla notes that US arms deals come with challenges - private firms prioritise profit over long-term partnerships. Yet with delays and cost overruns affecting some of India's arms deals with Russia, Delhi's defence ties with the US look set to deepen.Modi met Tesla CEO Elon Musk to discuss AI and emerging tech, India's foreign ministry said.It's unclear if they addressed Musk's stalled plans for Starlink's India launch or Tesla's market entry. Musk has pushed for direct spectrum allocation, clashing with Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani, who favours auctions. His licence remains under review.India is also courting Tesla to set up a car factory, cutting EV import taxes for automakers committing $500m and local production within three years. Tesla has yet to confirm its plans.In a rare move, Modi joined Trump at a press conference, answering two questions - on illegal immigration and the US Department of Justice (DOJ) bribery charges against the Adani Group.Indian billionaire Gautam Adani, accused of close ties with Modi, was charged with fraud in the US last November over an alleged $250m bribery scheme. Modi said he hadn't discussed the issue with Trump. On immigration, he stated India was ready to take back verified illegal Indian migrants.This was only Modi's third direct press Q&A in his almost 11-year tenure as India's prime minister. He has never held a solo press conference. In 2019 he sat beside then party president Amit Shah as Shah answered all the questions and in 2023, he took just two questions alongside former President Joe Biden.

10 March 2025ShareSaveCherylann MollanBBC News, MumbaiShareSaveThe prime minister of Vanuatu has ordered the cancellation of a passport issued by the island nation to fugitive Indian businessman Lalit Modi, who is wanted by Delhi in a corruption case.The order came three days after India confirmed that Mr Modi had got citizenship of Vanuatu, a string of more than 80 islands in the Pacific Ocean.Mr Modi, the former chief of the Indian Premier League (IPL), is wanted for allegedly rigging bids during his tenure as the head of the world's richest cricket tournament.Mr Modi, who has been living in the UK since 2010, has always denied the allegations. India has made several unsuccessful attempts to extradite him.On Friday, India's foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told reporters that Mr Modi had applied to surrender his Indian passport in London."We are also given to understand that he has acquired citizenship of Vanuatu. We continue to pursue the case against him as required under law," Jaiswal had said.The news of Mr Modi becoming a Vanuatu citizen had made headlines in India, where he was once the face of the glamorous, cash-rich IPL tournament. He was a regular presence on the social scene, rubbing shoulders with Bollywood stars and India's elite.But on Monday, Vanuatu's Prime Minister Jotham Napat announced that his country had decided to cancel Mr Modi's citizenship. Napat said a Vanuatu passport was a "privilege" and that "applicants must seek citizenship for legitimate reasons"."None of those legitimate reasons include attempting to avoid extradition, which the recent facts brought to light clearly indicate was Mr Modi's intention," a media release quoted Napat as saying.He said that background checks and Interpol screenings conducted during Mr Modi's application for a passport had shown no criminal convictions.But, he added, that in the past 24 hours, he had been made aware that Interpol had twice rejected India's requests to issue an alert notice on Mr Modi, citing a lack of "substantive judicial evidence"."Any such alert would've triggered an automatic rejection of Mr Modi's citizenship application," the release added. The move is likely to bring relief to Indian authorities. Unlike the UK, Vanuatu does not have an extradition treaty with India. Extradition treaties allow repatriation of people accused of crimes between countries.A day earlier, Mr Modi wrote in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that there were no cases pending against him in any court in India and accused the media of peddling "fake news" about him.Mr Modi was instrumental in founding the IPL in 2008, which has now become a multi-billion-dollar industry. The main accusations against Mr Modi relate to rigging bids during the auction of two team franchises in 2010. He was also accused of selling broadcasting and internet rights without authorisation.In 2013, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) banned Mr Modi from any involvement in cricket activities for life.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
