Media and technology company Thomson Reuters recently won a legal battle against a now-defunct legal research firm over the question of fair use in AI-related copyright cases, while other cases involving visual artists, news organizations and others are still working through U.S. courts. The National Publishing Union, which represents book publishers, has noted that \u201cnumerous works\u201d from its members are turning up in Meta\u2019s data pool, the group\u2019s president, Vincent Montagne, said in a joint statement.",

Meta said it won\u2019t decide what gets rated or written and the notes \u201cwon\u2019t be published unless contributors with a range of viewpoints broadly agree on them.\u201d And unlike with fact checks, where posts that were determined to be misinformation had their distribution reduced, posts with Community Notes won\u2019t be penalized, Meta said. Meta began fact checks in December 2016, after President Donald Trump was elected to his first term, in response to criticism that \u201cfake news\u201d was spreading on its platforms.",

                "Comparison": "Article 10 highlights Meta's shift towards prioritizing free speech, a move celebrated by conservatives and criticized by liberals and advertisers, framing it as a strategic maneuver potentially influenced by Donald Trump. Conversely, Article 8 scrutinizes this shift, focusing on the potential negative consequences, including increased harmful content like hate speech and disinformation, and the company's seeming disregard for user safety, particularly for vulnerable groups.  Article 8 provides specific examples of the potential harms, referencing past failures in addressing violence incited on the platform, while Article 10 offers a more politically charged analysis of the decision's implications.",

Article 8's warnings of increased harm, particularly concerning hate speech and disinformation, suggest the possibility of legal repercussions, reputational damage, and decreased user trust.  Article 10's analysis implies potential benefits for Meta in terms of improved relations with conservative groups and a reduction in censorship-related controversies; however, it also highlights the risk of alienating advertisers and losing users who are concerned about the increase in harmful content.  Ultimately, the net impact on Meta's user base, advertising revenue, and public image remains uncertain and heavily dependent on how effectively Meta manages the transition and mitigates the foreseeable negative consequences."
