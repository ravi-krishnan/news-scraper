            "Summary": "24 February 2025ShareSaveShaimaa KhalilTokyo correspondentShareSaveFor months, Japan's entertainment industry has been rocked by a scandal that unseated one of its most popular celebrities and put one of its biggest broadcasters at risk.But some believe it has also marked a turning point in how cases of sexual assault are perceived in Japan - where traditionally victims have been shamed into silence.At its heart was Masahiro Nakai, a household name and leading presenter for Fuji TV, one of the country's biggest broadcasters.Nakai, who is also a former member of J-pop boy band SMAP, was accused of sexually assaulting a woman at a dinner party in 2023.The revelations, which appeared last December in the weekly tabloid magazine Josei Seven and were then picked up by the Shukan Bunshun, marked the latest of a series of scandals involving celebrities in Japan, including that of late entertainment mogul Johnny Kitagawa, who was found by investigators to have abused hundreds of boys and young men over six decades.Nakai didn't admit guilt and denied using force against the woman. The firm said its executive vice-president Kenji Shimizu would replace Mr Minato as president.But this was seen as a mere  face-saving exercise to appease advertisers rather than a sign of substantial change - especially because the president's replacement belonged to the same leadership cadre.Professor Osawa told the BBC, however, that high-profile cases like Fuji TV become important precedents for real change.And this is the latest saga in a series of prominent sexual misconduct cases that have generated conversation about women's rights in Japan.These include the case of journalist Shiori Ito, who became a symbol of the country's MeToo movement in 2017. \"There's still a prevalent attitude of  'Shoganai ' or 'there's nothing you can do' that is being projected on women - so they're encouraged to keep silent,\" Machiko Osawa, professor emeritus at Japan Women's University in Tokyo, told the BBC.She added that women were seldom believed and did not have proper mechanisms to even report such incidents, which contributed to this culture of silence.Ms Kojima said that the media industry, in particular, has long had a culture of impunity and lack of accountability where many young women felt they must keep silent to keep their jobs.",
