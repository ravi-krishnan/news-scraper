Donald Trump’s support for Elon Musk’s car company could end up hurting it.
Tesla investors cheered Tuesday as Trump came to the defense of Musk’s beleaguered and boycotted carmaker by lavishing the Tesla CEO with praise in a press conference as five Teslas lined up in the White House driveway. Trump called Musk a “patriot” and announced that he had even bought one of his cars — a show of support that may have helped Tesla stock close higher for the day after a plunge a day earlier. 
But experts warn the unusual presidential backing of a private company could backfire.
“Tesla is becoming a political symbol of Trump and DOGE, and that is a bad thing for the brand,” said Wedbush Securities financial analyst Dan Ives, referring to the advisory group in charge of cutting government spending led by Musk. “You think it’s helping, but it’s actually hurting.” 
Tesla’s stock began rising from the opening Tuesday after Trump posted overnight on his Truth Social platform that Musk was “putting it on the line” to help the country. Trump claimed in the post that “Radical Left Lunatics” were attempting to “illegally and collusively boycott Tesla, one of the World’s great automakers, and Elon’s ’baby.’”
A few hours later, Tesla stock surged even higher as Trump announced at the White House that he had bought a Tesla himself.

“I don’t like what’s happening to you,” said Trump, before picking a red Model S, which retails for $80,000. As he eased into the driver seat, he exclaimed, “Wow. That’s beautiful.” 


The stock ended up closing up nearly 4% on Tuesday after one of the worst single day sell-offs in Tesla’s history a day earlier.
Tesla has been pummeled this year under competition from rival electric vehicles, particularly out of China. Numerous auto industry analysts have also pointed to Musk’s close association with Trump and with far right causes globally. Tesla showrooms in the U.S. have been besieged by protesters and its vehicles vandalized on the street. Tesla owners, perhaps in a bid to avoid being targeted, have placed bumper stickers on their cars with messages like, “I bought it before Elon went nuts.” 
Shares have plummeted 45% in 2025 and on Monday tumbled more than 15% to $222.15, the lowest since late October, reflecting newfound pessimism as sales crater around the globe. 
Musk pumped $270 million into Trump’s campaign heading into the 2024 election, appeared on stage with him and cheered Trump’s victory over Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in November. Tesla shares soared to $479 per share by mid-December, but are now trading around $230 per share.
That drop could hurt the company in the coming year in two ways.
First, Tesla offers many of its workers the chance to buy shares at a discounted price as a way of incentivizing them. But with the stock down sharply, this discounted price offered last year is in many cases higher than the stock is currently trading, meaning there is no discount at all and the incentive is worthless. 
Second, the price drop could limit Tesla’s ability to raise money by selling newly created shares to investors to fund research and expansion. In 2020, the company sold $12 billion worth of shares as it was building factories in Berlin and Texas and pouring money into self-driving technology. A falling stock price means it will get far less in proceeds in any future so-called secondary offerings, though slumping sales means it may not need to expand soon.
Musk has become the face of the Trump administration’s slash-and-burn government downsizing efforts, known as the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The department has promised massive federal worker layoffs and aims to drastically reduce government spending. Musk’s involvement has raised a familiar issue for Tesla shareholders: That the CEO, who also runs several other companies, is too distracted to fully focus on his EV company.
Some of those other companies have also run into trouble recently. His X social media platform crashed several times on Monday, which Musk claimed was a “massive” cyberattack. But like the clear-cutting he’s done with federal jobs, Musk slashed the number of employees at X and technology experts warned of increased vulnerability. 
Last week, a rocket launched by Musk’s SpaceX exploded and broke apart over Florida, about two months after another of the company’s rockets failed.

NEW YORK (AP) — Elon Musk’s car company is required each year to report to investors all the bad things that could happen to it, and the latest version lists every imaginable threat from costly lawsuits to out-of-control battery fires to war and another epidemic.
But there’s barely any mention in the latest annual update of Musk’s full-bore entry into right-wing politics, which some experts say is turning off potential customers who don’t share his views.
“It’s marketing 101: Don’t involve yourself in politics,” said New York brand consultant Robert Passikoff. “People will stop buying your products.”
It may be too late. 
Tesla sales plunged 45% in Europe in January, according to research firm Jato Dynamics, even as overall electric vehicle sales rose. That comes after a report of falling sales in California, its biggest U.S. market, and the first annual drop globally for the company last year.
“I don’t even want to drive it,” said Model 3 owner John Parnell, a Democrat from Ross, California, adding that he also is cancelling his order for the company’s Cybertruck, losing a $100 deposit. “He’s destroying the brand with his politics.”
Car industry analysts say it’s too early to say for sure how much damage Musk is causing to Tesla because so many other factors could explain its current troubles. It’s best selling vehicle, the Model Y, is coming out with a new version this year, leading potential Tesla buyers to hold off purchases right now. And European and Chinese manufacturers are finally catching up to the world’s EV leader, offering cars with battery life and dependability that are competitive.


But, if anything, that makes Musk’s political comments even more reckless, auto analysts say.
“Musk thinks he can say anything he wants to and doesn’t think Tesla will suffer any consequences,“ said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein. “Tesla was in the sweet spot. Now it has competition.”
The sales numbers were particularly bad in Germany and France in January, down roughly 60% each, more than the average decline for the more than two-dozen European countries surveyed. Sales in France fell another 26% in February.
More worrisome was the breakdown for Tesla’s individual models. Sales of Tesla’s Model 3 dropped 33% across all European countries even though that car is not being updated and there is no reason for buyers to wait
“Part of the population is not happy with his views, his political activism,” said Jato senior analyst Felipe Munoz who had shrugged off the boycott threat earlier this year, but is now having second thoughts. 
Many Tesla buyers used to be wealthy, environmentally-conscious professionals, often liberal, who were attracted to Musk’s talk about how his EVs could help save the planet from fossil-fuel destruction. 
Not anymore. 
“I used to be adored by the left,” Musk said in an interview with Tucker Carlson on February 18 as his stock was halfway through a nearly 30% plunge for the month. “Less so these days.”
His decision to spend $270 million on Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and publicly back him was risky enough for his business. Then he doubled down, pursuing a slash-and-burn strategy as head of Trump’s government efficiency team and taking his political revolution and incendiary talk abroad.
He has backed the far-right, pro-Russian, anti-Muslim party in German y, called the British p rime minister an “evil tyrant” who runs a “police state,” and stated recently about a U.S. neighbor and major Tesla market, “Canada is not a real country.”
The backlash has been fierce.
Tesla showrooms in the U.S. have been besieged by protesters, its vehicles vandalized and bumper stickers appearing on its cars with sayings such as, “I bought it before Elon went nuts.” 
An effigy of Musk was hung in Milan and image of him doing a straight-arm salute projected on a Tesla factory outside Berlin. In London, a bus stop poster of him above the word “swasticars” lit up social media. A Polish government minister called for a Tesla boycott.
“I will not buy a Tesla again,” said Jens Fischer, a 50-year-old microscope salesman in Witten, Germany, who thinks Musk is “destabilizing democracy” and has slapped one of those “Elon went nuts” stickers on his Model 3. “I’d sell if I got a good offer.”
Tesla investor Ross Gerber says Musk has somehow managed to marry the world’s best product with the world’s worst marketing. 
“People want to buy stuff that makes them feel good, you don’t want politics involved,” said Gerber, a money manager whose portfolios hold nearly $60 million in Tesla stock. “It’s even worse when you have such divisive issues, whether it’s firing climate scientists or taking aid away from starving African children.”
Boycotts have a habit of fizzling out, and Morningstar’s Goldstein says that buying a car is too big a decision and costs too much to make them successful targets, anyway. 
One Tesla owner, Londoner Harry Chathli, is unmoved by the backlash, saying he has no intention of getting rid of his Tesla S. He has nothing but praise for Musk who he calls a visionary for transforming “the way we think about transportation and the future of our planet.”
But if Tesla’s stock is any indicator, the company’s prospects are deteriorating, and Musk’s position in the Trump administration isn’t helping. As of Friday, it has dropped 37% since its Inauguration Day, a loss of $550 billion in investor wealth.

2025-02-13
BEIJING (AP) — Zhang Yazhou was sitting in the passenger seat of her Tesla Model 3 when she said she heard her father’s panicked voice: The brakes don’t work! Approaching a red light, her father swerved around two cars before plowing into an SUV and a sedan and crashing into a large concrete barrier.
Stunned, Zhang gazed at the deflating airbag in front of her. She could never have imagined what was to come: Tesla sued her for defamation for complaining publicly about the car’s brakes — and won. A Chinese court ordered Zhang to pay more than $23,000 in damages and publicly apologize to the $1.1 trillion company.
Zhang is not the only one to find herself in the crosshairs of Tesla, which is led by Elon Musk, among the richest men in the world and a self-described “ free speech absolutist.” Over the last four years, Tesla has sued at least six car owners in China who had sudden vehicle malfunctions, quality complaints or accidents they claimed were caused by mechanical failures. 
The company has also sued at least six bloggers and two Chinese media outlets that wrote critically about the company, according to a review of public court documents and Chinese media reports by The Associated Press. Tesla won all 11 cases for which AP could determine the verdicts. Two judgments, including Zhang’s, are on appeal. One case was settled out of court.
It is not common practice for automakers — in China or elsewhere — to sue their customers. But Tesla has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy and leveraged the patronage of powerful leaders in China’s ruling Communist Party to silence critics, reap financial rewards and limit its accountability.


The AP review of Tesla’s record in China comes as Musk is wielding significant influence in President Donald Trump’s new administration, leading an effort to rapidly shrink the size of the federal government and oust employees deemed disloyal to the president. His actions have raised concerns that Musk is weakening the U.S. system of checks and balances, in part, to benefit Tesla and his other companies. 
In the United States, Musk has found a powerful ally in Trump. Together, they have launched an assault on the federal government, freezing spending, suspending programs and dismissing prosecutors, government watchdogs and others that have traditionally acted as guardrails.
Tesla officials in China and the United States did not reply to requests for comment.

Tesla’s record in China shows how Musk has thrived in a system in which regulators, the media and the courts — which must all ultimately answer to the ruling Communist Party — are, by design, somewhat intertwined.
Tesla has profited from the largesse of the Chinese state, winning unprecedented regulatory benefits, below-market rate loans and large tax breaks. With a few pointed exceptions, Tesla has enjoyed ingratiating coverage in the Chinese press, and journalists told AP they have been instructed to avoid negative coverage of the automaker. 
Tesla’s windfall has extended to the courts — and not just in legal actions Tesla has brought against customers. In a review of public court documents, AP found that Tesla won nearly 90% of civil cases over safety, quality or contract disputes brought by customers.
“The government gave Tesla a super status that put consumers in a very vulnerable position,” said Qiao Yudong, a former lawyer for American sports car company Saleen Automotive in China. “That’s why some consumers had to resort to extreme actions.”
One of those desperate customers was Zhang.
The February 2021 crash in central China’s Henan province sent Zhang’s mother and father, who had a concussion, to the hospital for four days, medical records show. Zhang — who was unharmed in the accident, as was her baby niece — wanted to understand what had happened: How could her dream car have turned into such a nightmare?

Traffic police determined that the crash was her dad’s fault because he hadn’t maintained a safe following distance. Zhang, however, insisted that the brakes had malfunctioned, sending the car out of control. She filed a complaint with a local market regulator, requesting a refund and compensation. Teslas are among the most computerized cars on the market, so Zhang asked the automaker to turn over the full pre-crash data from her car, hoping it might help explain what went wrong. Tesla refused.
“Tesla’s employees were very arrogant and tough in dealing with my complaints,” Zhang said in an interview. “I was burning with anger.”
After weeks of stewing, she draped her damaged car with a banner proclaiming “Tesla brake failure” in front of the Tesla dealership in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province, some 200 km (124 miles) from her home. She sat on the Tesla’s roof and blared her protest through a bullhorn: “Tesla Model 3 brakes failed,” she said. “A family of four almost died.” The next month, she parked her damaged car outside an auto show in Zhengzhou. It was all to no avail — Tesla refused to turn over the full data and mediation went nowhere.

Figuring that top Tesla officials would attend an April auto show in Shanghai, she and a friend — who had also had a problem with her Tesla — donned matching T-shirts with the phrase “Brakes fail” and headed for Tesla’s booth, determined to buttonhole executives. The automaker’s officials avoided them, Zhang said, and they couldn’t get anyone to hear them out.
Her friend, who was six months pregnant, started shouting, “Tesla brakes fail!”
Zhang clambered on top of a shiny red display model and started hollering, too.
“Things escalated,” said Zhang.
The moment — captured on cellphone videos shot by onlookers — went viral on Chinese social media. Burly security guards hauled Zhang out, and she was detained for five days.

Some observers speculated that Zhang’s protest had been orchestrated -- perhaps by a competitor or by the Chinese government itself to pressure Tesla to conform with Chinese regulations. Tesla alleged that Zhang hadn’t acted on her own. A top executive speculated to Chinese media that she “had someone behind her” and said Zhang was making a fuss because she just wanted higher compensation.
Zhang insisted she acted on her own — and out of anguish. Outraged, she sued Tesla for defamation, arguing that the executive’s comments unjustly cast her as a troublemaker to deflect attention from the company’s own shortcomings. 
And then she found herself on the receiving end of a lawsuit filed by Tesla.
Tesla said Zhang had deliberately spread false information that damaged the brand and asked for 5 million yuan ($684,000) in damages.
The case, which a court took up in October 2021, came as Tesla faced a barrage of criticism in China.
Dozens of Tesla owners had been publicly complaining about alleged brake failures, battery fires, unintended acceleration and other defects, as well as what they claimed were misleading sales practices. The same month as Zhang’s crash, Chinese regulators summoned Tesla to respond to quality concerns raised by such reports.
Zhang’s emotional protest sparked a rare burst of criticism of Tesla in Chinese media. Under pressure from regulators, Tesla finally released the data from her car, which the company said showed her father had been driving nearly 120 km per hour (75 mph) and that the brakes had functioned to reduce the magnitude of the collision.
Tesla had finally given Zhang what she’d been asking for, but they’d published the data publicly and included her vehicle identification number. She said she and her family started getting threatened and doxed online. Besides, she wondered, how could she be sure Tesla hadn’t modified or redacted the data from her car? It was less than the victory she’d hoped for. Feeling besieged, she sued Tesla a second time, in March 2022, for invading her privacy.
Zhang lost both cases she brought against Tesla.
Meanwhile, the defamation case against her was grinding along. Back in court as a defendant, Zhang was unable to prove that the brakes on her Tesla had indeed failed. In a closed trial, a Shanghai court ruled in May 2024 that Zhang’s public complaints went beyond what magistrates considered reasonable, factual criticism and ordered her to publicly apologize and pay 170,000 RMB ($23,000) to cover damages and the legal costs of the world’s most valuable car company.
Zhang appealed the ruling. She maintains that her lawsuit is a cry for transparency and accountability and that a company as rich and powerful as Tesla should be able to tolerate legitimate criticism from its customers.
“I refuse to accept it,” Zhang told The Associated Press, “As a consumer, even if I said something wrong, I have the right to comment and criticize. I spoke about my feelings as a user of the car. It has nothing to do with damaging their reputation.”
Her odds of winning the appeal against Tesla do not look good. Tesla has not only won the defamation cases it brought against unhappy car owners and critical journalists, it’s also prevailed in lawsuits customers have filed against it.
An AP review of a Chinese government database of court filings published online found 81 civil judgments in which car owners sued Tesla over safety and quality issues or contract disputes. Car owners won in only nine of those cases.
In a statement to AP, the Shanghai High People’s Court said that judgments are the result of a “fair trial” based on “the objective facts of the case.” 
“It cannot be assumed that the party has received ‘special protection’ or ‘special treatment’ because of their victory,” the court wrote.

While some auto industry experts in China say it’s generally difficult for customers to win cases against car companies, others say it’s remarkable for a foreign company to enjoy such success in Chinese courts.
“For Tesla to win that percentage of the time is an anomaly,” said Bill Russo, founder of Automobility Ltd., an advisory firm based in Shanghai, who also used to be regional head of Chrysler in northeast Asia. “The odds are stacked against you. It’s like going to the casino and winning every hand.”
Tesla’s commercial and political success in China has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: Li Qiang, the former party boss of Shanghai who is now China’s premier, second in rank only to President Xi Jinping. It was under his watch, in 2019, that Tesla built its first overseas factory on the outskirts of China’s financial capital.

With Li’s support, Tesla became the first foreign automaker allowed to retain complete control over its China venture and got low-interest loans and generous tax breaks. China also adopted an emissions credit scheme modeled after a U.S. program that has generated billions in income for Tesla.
In January 2020, one year after breaking ground, Elon Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas on a stage in Shanghai. Tesla turned an annual profit for the first time in its history that year, and Musk was declared the world’s richest person in January 2021.
China got what it wanted, too: Tesla was a potent catalyst for domestic production and consumption. Before Tesla’s arrival, new energy vehicles accounted for around 5% of China’s auto market. Today, analysts say, more than half of passenger vehicles sold retail in China are powered by an electric motor. Chinese battery maker CATL, a key Tesla supplier, has embedded itself in global supply chains to become the world’s largest EV-battery maker. China’s BYD is now the world’s largest electric vehicle manufacturer and a growing competitive threat to legacy carmakers in the West.
“Tesla had a large part to play in that,” said Tu Le, the managing director of Sino Auto Insights, a consulting firm. Tu said the way the government smoothed the way for Musk’s factory was critical. “It was a swampy field on the outskirts of Shanghai. A year later they’re rolling cars off the line,” he said. “I don’t know if that happens anywhere else in the world.”
Requests for comment to the State Council, which is run by Li Qiang and oversees China’s government ministries, went unanswered.
Musk still swings by to meet Li when he goes to China. Their encounters underscore the complexity of Musk’s overlapping interests as a businessman and the most China-friendly member of Trump’s inner circle.
Musk’s “greater objective was winning influence over the people that mattered for him, that enabled him to get things done,” said Russo, the auto strategist in Shanghai. “He’s done a good job of it in China and he’s done it now with the influence he purchased with his relationship with Trump.”
Safety advocates worry about the implications of Musk’s proximity to power in the United States. Federal investigations and safety initiatives Musk has long railed against could be easily snuffed out by the new administration.
In the U.S., Tesla also has been subject to a raft of customer safety complaints and lawsuits over autopilot function, battery charging, alleged suspension defects, sudden braking or acceleration, faulty airbags and allegedly monopolistic practices on repairs and parts. Judges have dismissed some cases. In others, Tesla settled out of court or paid hefty settlements.
Tesla has not publicly sued any of its U.S. customers for speaking out, though in January, Musk said on X that “maybe it is time” to sue media outlets for coverage that could stain Tesla’s brand. His post has been viewed more than 22 million times.
Tesla has already successfully done that in China.
Two Chinese journalists based in Shanghai told AP there is an unwritten rule to avoid critical coverage of Tesla. Both spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation.
“We were told by our editor that we should not write negatively about Tesla because it is a key company that was introduced and protected by the Shanghai government,” a tech reporter told AP.
Those who have strayed have found themselves in court. Musk’s company sued media outlets PingWest and ifeng.com over negative coverage. It was unhappy about PingWest’s report that claimed Tesla’s Shanghai factory was a “sweatshop.” The news website ifeng.com drew Tesla’s ire over a story that explored the tribulations of car owners who fought Tesla. PingWest had to apologize and pay Tesla 100,000 yuan ($13,700). AP could not determine the outcome of the case against ifeng.com.
Tesla is not the only company in its industry to sue its critics. BYD has also aggressively pursued media in court, including an unsuccessful lawsuit against Vice Media in the United States. More recently, electric vehicle makers Nio and Li Auto have stepped up defamation cases against bloggers in China who allegedly spread false information about their companies.
Tesla, however, stands out even among its cut-throat Chinese competitors — in going after car owners who suffered crashes.
“Tesla used their legal advantages to bully Chinese car owners and people who speak up for them,” said Feng Shiming, an auto blogger and Tesla owner who was ordered by a Shanghai court last year to pay Tesla 250,000 yuan ($34,200) after he wrote about Tesla’s alleged brake failures. He has appealed the verdict. “Tesla wants to have a chilling effect on society and terrify people so they will be scared to say anything negative about Tesla.”
Chen Junyi got the message. He lost control of his Model 3 and plowed into a dozen cars in a parking lot at high speed in August 2020. He claimed the brakes had failed. He told Chinese media at the time that he broke his back and four ribs and had to have 30 centimeters (12 inches) of his small intestine removed. Chen took to social media and warned people not to buy Teslas, raising his shirt to reveal the long, gnarled scar that runs up his abdomen.
Tesla maintained the accident was Chen’s fault, citing a technical review that found the car was accelerating and not braking in the seconds before the crash, and sued him for making false claims.
“Tesla should proactively respond to consumers instead of using its superior resources and filing lawsuits against consumers who are at a disadvantage,” Chen said in a court statement reviewed by AP. “I almost lost my life because of the car accident. I lost my job and income. I am under tremendous economic pressure.”
This excerpt from a legal document shows that a Chinese civil court ordered Chen Junyi to publicly apologize to Tesla (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. and to pay the company $6,800. (AP Illustration/Allen G. Breed) 

Chen declined to speak with the AP, citing fear of retaliation. A Chinese court ordered Chen to pay the carmaker 50,000 yuan ($6,800) as compensation — and to issue an apology.
“I deeply regret the serious negative impacts I have had on Tesla and its cars,” he wrote. “I hereby sincerely apologize to Tesla and to the people who were misled by my remarks.”
A month later, he took to social media and apologized for his apology, saying the words were not his own.
Chen and Kinetz reported from Washington.

12 March 2025ShareSaveTom Espiner, Theo Leggett and Lucy HookerBBC NewsShareSavePeople protesting against Tesla should be labelled domestic terrorists, President Donald Trump said on Tuesday at a White House media event designed to bolster Elon Musk's electric car company.Trump sat in the driver's seat of a brand new red Tesla that he said he planned to buy, with Musk in the passenger seat, but did not test drive it.Demonstrators have targeted Tesla showrooms in recent weeks in protest against Musk's cost-cutting role in Trump's administration.Trump said they were "harming a great American company", and anyone using violence against the electric carmaker would "go through hell".The president described the shiny red Model-S, one of a number of Teslas lined up on the White House drive, as "beautiful" but said he was no longer allowed to drive and so would keep the car for the use of White House staff. Current and former presidents are not allowed to drive for security reasons.He also said he would not want to buy a self-driving model, which Musk said would reach the market next year.The showcase for Tesla's cars outside the White House came after Tesla's market value halved since its all-time peak in December, sliding 15% in a single day on Monday, before recovering slightly on Tuesday.Trump said he had told Musk, "You know, Elon, I don't like what's happening to you, and Tesla's a great company."Musk, Trump's top donor in the election campaign, has been tasked with radically cutting government spending through his Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). He has instigated sweeping cuts to the federal workforce, cancelled international aid programmes, and has voiced support for far-right politics.That has prompted a backlash among Tesla owners."Tesla takedown" protests have seen demonstrators gather outside dealerships, in Portland, Oregon, last week, and New York City earlier in March, with the aim of undermining the Tesla brand. Organisers behind the protests said on social media that the demonstrations were peaceful, but a few have been destructive with fires intentionally set at Tesla showrooms and charging stations in Colorado and Massachusetts last week.Asked in front of the White House whether such protesters should be labelled "domestic terrorists", the president said "I will do that", a position later confirmed by a White House spokesperson."You do it to Tesla and you do it to any company, we're going to catch you and you're going to go through hell," Trump said.On his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump blamed Tesla's share price falls on "radical left lunatics", who he said were trying to "illegally and collusively boycott" the firm.However, stock analysts said the main reason for the poor performance of the shares was fear about Tesla meeting production targets and a drop in sales over the past year.UBS warned that new Tesla deliveries could be much lower than expected this year.Lindsay James, an investment strategist at Quilter Investors, said that although there was "an element" of Elon Musk's politics having a "brand impact", there were other reasons for the share price fall.Ultimately the drop came down to "hard numbers", she said."When we look at new orders, for example in Europe and China, you can see that they've effectively halved over the last year," she said.Sales in Europe have fallen sharply this year. Across the continent, they were down 45% in January compared to the same month in 2024, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA).There has also been a steep decline in China – a key market – and Australia.Some experts have said Tesla is over-valued, so the fall is seen as a correction, while others have pointed to rising competition from some of China's electric vehicle companies.Investors are "certainly getting more worried about an economic slowdown too, so the richest-valued companies like Tesla have been hit hardest in recent days", Ms James said.There have also been concerns that Musk has not been focusing enough of his attention on his firms.In an interview with Fox Business on Monday, he said he was combining the Doge role with running his businesses "with great difficulty".Alongside Tesla, his businesses include Space X, which has experienced serious failures in the last two launches of its giant Starship rocket, and the social media network X, which suffered an outage on Monday.Despite his supportive comments, President Trump's policies so far have been designed to limit electric car sales in the US, including revoking a 2021 order by former president Joe Biden that half of all car sales should be electric by 2030, and halting unspent government funds for charging stations.Trump's tariffs could also hurt the manufacturer. Tesla chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja said in January that Tesla parts sourced from Canada and Mexico would be subject to the levies and that this could hit profitability.Tesla's share price fall came against a broader US market slump on Monday as investors, concerned about the economic effects of Trump's tariffs and weakening confidence in the economy, sold shares.Sign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the biggest developments in global technology, with analysis from BBC correspondents around the world.

12 hours agoShareSaveNatalie ShermanBBC NewsShareSaveThousands of Tesla Cybertrucks have been recalled in the US due to concerns about part of the electric car's trim falling off in the model's eighth and largest ever recall.The issue affects more than 46,000 trucks made starting in November 2023, which analysts say amounts to nearly all Cybertrucks.It comes as Tesla, which did not respond to a request for comment, grapples with falling sales amid a backlash against the firm and its boss Elon Musk.On Thursday, US Attorney General Pam Bondi said three unnamed people would face charges for setting fire to Tesla cars and charging stations, accusing them of "domestic terrorism".Tesla does not break out sales of the Cybertruck, but car tech firm Cox Automotive has estimated roughly 39,000 were sold in the US last year.  Prior Cybertruck recalls involved failing windshield wipers, trapped accelerator pedals, possible loss of drive power to the wheels, and other issues. Tesla started investigating the latest issue, involving a piece formally known as the cant rail, in January, according to filings with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)."The cant rail, a stainless-steel exterior trim panel, can delaminate and detach from the vehicle," the notice said."A detached panel can become a road hazard, increasing the risk of a crash."Tesla told NHTSA it had received about 150 claims from drivers about the issue but was not aware of any accidents caused by the problem. It estimated that the issue affected about 1% of vehicles involved in the recall. The issue is covered under a warranty for new owners, and the company will replace the piece free-of-charge.Tesla's shares have dropped nearly 40% since January, erasing the jump in value that it enjoyed after the 2024 US election.The fall has been significantly more than the overall drop in the US stock market over that period.Dan Ives, an analyst who has historically been very pro-Tesla, said on Thursday the firm was facing a "tornado crisis moment" due to brand damage from Musk's political role.The political backlash adds to the challenges the company had already been facing from increased competition and an ageing line-up of offerings.
